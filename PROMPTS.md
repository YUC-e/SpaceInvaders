Prompt: 
I'm building Space Invaders in Java using Swing, split into three files: GameModel.java, GameView.java, and GameController.java. GameView should extend JPanel and be hosted in a JFrame. GameController should have the main method and wire the three classes together. GameModel must have no Swing imports. For now, just create the three class shells with placeholder comments describing what each class will do. The program should compile and open a blank window.

Prompt:
Fill in GameModel.java. The model should track: the player's horizontal position, the alien formation (5 rows of 11), the player's bullet (one at a time), alien bullets, the score, and lives remaining (start with 3). Add logic to: move the player left and right, fire a player bullet if one isn't already in flight, advance the player's bullet each tick, move the alien formation right until the edge then down and reverse, fire alien bullets at random intervals, and detectcollisions between bullets and aliens or the player. No Swing Imports.

Prompt:
Fill in GameView.java. It should take a reference to the model and draw everything the player sees: the player, alien formation, both sets of bullets, the score, and remaining lives. Show a centered game-over message when the game ends. The view should only read from the model -- it must never change the game state.

Prompt:
Fill in GameController.java. Add keyboard controls so the player can move left and right with the arrow keys and fire with spacebar. Add a game loop using a Swing timer that updates the model each tick and redraws the view. Stop the loop when the game is over.

Prompt:
Create a seperate file called ModelTester.java with a main method. It should create a GameModel, call its methods directly, and print PASS or FAIL for each check. Write tests for at least five behaviors: the player cannot move past the left or right edge, firing while a bullet is already in flight does nothing, a bullet that reaches the top is removed, destroying an alien increases the score, and losing all lives triggers the game-over state. No testing libraries -- just plain Java.

Prompt:
In GameController.Java, add the ability to reset the game when the user presses R.

Prompt:
In GameModel.java, add a list of shield rectangles positioned between the player and the alien formation. Reduce a shield's health when hit by a bullet from either side. Remove the shield when health reaches zero. No swing imports.

Prompt:
In GameController.java, change the timer set in gameLoop to be faster to make the game feel more smooth.
